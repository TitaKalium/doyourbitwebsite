        <h3>Littering. </h3>
        
        Littering has became a very big problem since the 50's. Littering is when you discard garbage/rubbish in a form that might hurt the planet.
        <h4>An example might be: </h4>
        <p>Bob is an average man, and he just finished off his meal. There was a bin close by, but Bob is very lazy, so he discards his rubbish on the floor. The wind takes the rubbish, and it get blown to a nearby beach.</p>
        There is always a good ending though
        <br>
        <p>Gary finds Bob's rubbish in the ocean, and he swims to grab it.</p> 
        
        <h3>A good solution to the problem, using micro:bit</h3>

        <p>You can get a robot with a sensor, and it can run continuously run until there is rubbish. It then proceeds to make a little hole using the tyres, and makes a siren</p>
        <p>When a person detects it, there will be a button on the micro:bit that can show the person the last know rubbish location.</p>
        <p>It is also automatic, so if it detects a strong wind that the device cannot handle (via an accelerometer), it will dock itself. </p>
