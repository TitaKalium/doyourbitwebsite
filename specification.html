    <h2>2. Environmental Problem</h2>
Brainstorm 5 environmental problems and include the following for each:
an image of the environmental issue
state where it is occurring and explain why it is a problem
research an example of a product or system that attempts to address this problem. Include the name of product or system, the image of it and explain how it works.

        <h3>Littering. </h3>
        
        Littering has became a very big problem since the 50's. Littering is when you discard garbage/rubbish in a form that might hurt the planet.
        <h4>An example might be: </h4>
        <p>Bob is an average man, and he just finished off his meal. There was a bin close by, but Bob is very lazy, so he discards his rubbish on the floor. The wind takes the rubbish, and it get blown to a nearby beach.</p>
        There is always a good ending though
        <br>
        <p>Gary finds Bob's rubbish in the ocean, and he swims to grab it.</p> 
        
        <h3>A good solution to the problem, using micro:bit</h3>

        <p>You can get a robot with a sensor, and it can run continuously run until there is rubbish. It then proceeds to make a little hole using the tyres, and makes a siren</p>
        <p>When a person detects it, there will be a button on the micro:bit that can show the person the last know rubbish location.</p>
        <p>It is also automatic, so if it detects a strong wind that the device cannot handle (via an accelerometer), it will dock itself. </p>

        <h3>Air Pollution</h3>
        <p>Air pollution is occurring all over the world, but mainly in countries such as India. </p>
        <p>It is becoming a problem because people need to breathe in oxygen, but there are many products that are currently hurting the oxygen levels, like spray deodorant, hair spray or any products that are condensed into a bottle to be squeezed out of using the aid of carbon dioxide. </p>
        <p>Planting more trees or plants will be very helpful to the world, as they convert carbon dioxide into oxygen, hence giving us more space for us to breathe. It is kind of expensive, but at least it is a beautiful sight. A cheaper alternative would be to plant algae. Fun fact, algae are one of the very few plants that can help filter out carbon dioxide in the air, and it can multiply without the aid of seeds or anything like that. It can also self-sustain, so it won’t be too bad to filter out.  </p>

        <h3>Genetic Engineering</h3>
        <p>Genetic Engineering is starting to become a problem all over the world. </p>
        <p>It is becoming a problem because people need food, but certain plants cannot produce enough food to feed the whole world, and that is the problem. Scientists do Genetic Engineering for that reason. </p>
        <p>Stopping genetic engineering will become a problem, since people will need to be fed, but an alternative is to move agriculture to another place, like underground, with artificial sunlight, since plants can be grown via that. </p>

        <h3>Water Pollution</h3>
        <p>Water sources are contaminated by substances which make the water unusable for cooking, drinking or other activities. Pollutants can be germs, chemicals, garbage or bacteria. These pollutants make their way to water and made it unusable.
</p>
        <p>Main causes of water pollution: </p>
        <p> * Rapid urban development</p>
        <p> * Improper sewage disposal</p>
        <p> * Fertilizers</p>
        <p> * Oil spills</p>
        <p> * Chemical waste dumping</p>
        <p> * Radioactive waste</p>  
        <p>Water pollution occurs in all water sources like lakes, river, oceans, streams  etc. When above pollutants enter these water sources it makes them unusable. Water pollution is a global crisis.  Pollutants can enter water directly from factories or spills or leaks from oil pipelines. Wind, storm or littering esp plastic waste, agricultural can also end in to the water sources and contaminate it. </p>
          <p>Water pollutants come from point sources or dispersed sources. Example of point source is waste discharge directly from industries or city sewerage system.  A dispersed sources is very broad such as from agricultural area.</p>
</p>
        <p>It is a problem because toxic products build up and pollute water sources and then waterways become unusable to drink, unlivable for native plants, fish and animals. Pollution disrupts the natural food chain. Pollutants reduces oxygen levels in the water. Major cause of illness from contaminated drinking water. Diseases caused by pollutants are cholera, typhoid and Legionnaires’ disease. Swimming in contaminated water causes skin rashes. Solid waste such as plastic bags, cans will strangle, suffocate and starve marine animals.
</p>
        <p>Pollution from point source is easier to control.</p> 
        <p>Eg: Contaminated water can be collected and conveyed to single point and can be treated. </p>
        <p>Pollution from dispersed sources is difficult to control. Modern sewerage treatment plants is a way to control this type of pollution. Reduce plastic consumptions and reuse or recycle plastic when you can. Proper disposal of waste and use environmentally friendly products. Wastewater treatment plants-Remove nearly all pollutants via a chemical, physical or biological process prior entry into the water sources. Storm water management- storm water eventually reach rivers and oceans, storm water can be treated through a variety of processes eg: sand filtration, advanced oxidation.</p>

        <h3>Global Warming</h3>
        Global warming is an aspect of climate change- long-term rise of the planet’s temperature ( eg: Sea-level rises, ice mass loss in Greenland, Antarctica and extreme weather events)
        <p>Causes: </p>
        <p>Increased concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere ( eg burning fossil fuels and farming). Industrialization, Transport and vehicles, Waste, Oil drilling, Deforestation and tree clearing, Volcanic eruptions, mining, cattle rearing </p>
          <p> It occurs mostly in the troposphere, the lowest level of the atmosphere. This layer contains most of Earth’s clouds and is where living things and their habitats and weather primarily occur. Continued global warming impact everything from energy use to water availability and crop productivity. China is responsible for nearly 14 percent of global warming. </p>
        <p>Why it is a problem</p>
        <p>Rapid rise in greenhouse gases causes unpredictable climate which poses challenges to all life. Melting Greenland and Antarctica’s ice sheets could raise sea levels significantly. Extreme weather – major storms, longer and drier droughts- a challenge for growing crops. Rise in sea levels lead to the loss of coastal land. Threat to biodiversity. Heat waves, melting glaciers can harm animals, destroy places they live. Dangerous weather events are the effect of global warming. Higher death rates and higher wild life extinction. </p>
        <p>How to address it: </p>
        <p> Processes to address global warming. Eliminate fossil fuels wherever possible- transition to renewable and carbon free energy sources like solar, wind and hydro sources.  Fuel efficient vehicles and create more sustainable transportation habits ( walk and bike, climate friendly cars) Plant trees- reforestation is the most cost-effective way to prevent global warming- Trees absorbs carbon, enhanced water retention, soil health, food security and economic development. Invest in energy efficient appliances.

      <h2>3. Selection of an environmental issue</h2>
      <p>Select 1 environmental issue that you would like to explore for this project and complete the following task: </p>
      <p>Name the environmental issue and explain why you chose it</p>
      <div class="a1">
        <p>Since the bushfires and the mask regulations due to Covid, it is really bad that we have to worry about the quality of our air. Especially in places in India, where going outside every day for a year is like smoking 38 cigarettes, it is good that we should monitor our quality of our air. It can also be helpful if there is something burning or an unusual change of air uality, as the micro:bit will let you know. </p>
