    <h3>2. Environmental Problem</h3>
Brainstorm 5 environmental problems and include the following for each:
an image of the environmental issue
state where it is occurring and explain why it is a problem
research an example of a product or system that attempts to address this problem. Include the name of product or system, the image of it and explain how it works.

        <h3>Littering. </h3>
        
        Littering has became a very big problem since the 50's. Littering is when you discard garbage/rubbish in a form that might hurt the planet.
        <h4>An example might be: </h4>
        <p>Bob is an average man, and he just finished off his meal. There was a bin close by, but Bob is very lazy, so he discards his rubbish on the floor. The wind takes the rubbish, and it get blown to a nearby beach.</p>
        There is always a good ending though
        <br>
        <p>Gary finds Bob's rubbish in the ocean, and he swims to grab it.</p> 
        
        <h3>A good solution to the problem, using micro:bit</h3>

        <p>You can get a robot with a sensor, and it can run continuously run until there is rubbish. It then proceeds to make a little hole using the tyres, and makes a siren</p>
        <p>When a person detects it, there will be a button on the micro:bit that can show the person the last know rubbish location.</p>
        <p>It is also automatic, so if it detects a strong wind that the device cannot handle (via an accelerometer), it will dock itself. </p>

        <h3>Air Pollution</h3>
        <p>Air pollution is occurring all over the world, but mainly in countries such as India. </p>
        <p>It is becoming a problem because people need to breathe in oxygen, but there are many products that are currently hurting the oxygen levels, like spray deodorant, hair spray or any products that are condensed into a bottle to be squeezed out of using the aid of carbon dioxide. </p>
        <p>Planting more trees or plants will be very helpful to the world, as they convert carbon dioxide into oxygen, hence giving us more space for us to breathe. It is kind of expensive, but at least it is a beautiful sight. A cheaper alternative would be to plant algae. Fun fact, algae are one of the very few plants that can help filter out carbon dioxide in the air, and it can multiply without the aid of seeds or anything like that. It can also self-sustain, so it wonâ€™t be too bad to filter out.  </p>

        <h3>Genetic Engineering</h3>
        <p>Genetic Engineering is starting to become a problem all over the world. </p>
        <p>It is becoming a problem because people need food, but certain plants cannot produce enough food to feed the whole world, and that is the problem. Scientists do Genetic Engineering for that reason. </p>
        <p>Stopping genetic engineering will become a problem, since people will need to be fed, but an alternative is to move agriculture to another place, like underground, with artificial sunlight, since plants can be grown via that. </p>
